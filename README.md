## ABOUT
VillagerNames gives all villagers a pre-defined name. However it's very dysfunctional, now :D after all PocketMine-MP isn't a vanilla-survival based software!

## NOTE
   I plan to make this plugin part of my "advanced villager/village" system.
   While making this plugin, I was inspired by the mod here! [Villager Names](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villager-names)
